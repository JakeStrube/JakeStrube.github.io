**Choice:** Option 1: SI-8033JD Switching Voltage Regulator

**Rationale:** This switching voltage regulator emits an output of 3.3 volts when setup with an external circuit like shown in the detailed data sheet. The circuit is not complicated and does not require to many components externally. It also comes at a lower price than either of the other two options.It also allows a current operating range with a max of 1.5 A and a min voltage of 6.3 V with a max of 40V

#### Role on the team
My role on my team is to design and make the Human Machine Interface (HMI). I plan on doing this by using 3 buttons, a potentiometer, 2 LEDs and an OLED screen. The buttons will allow the user to do simple interactions like start the object following process or control a menu system that is displayed on the OLED screen. The OLED screen is going to be used to display sensor data and prompt instructions to the user on how to use it. The potentiometer will allow the user to select from a range of values to adjust the following distance or the speed of the robot itself. The LEDs will light up when a action is happening for example the green LED might turn on when the robot is in object following mode.


#### Pins needed
For my subsystem I require 12 pins not including power and ground or programming pins. I will need 5 digital input pins, 3 digital output pins, 2 pins for I2C connection, and then 2 for the UART connection. The selected microcontroller 

| Module | # Available | Needed | Associated Pins |
| ------ | ----------- | ------ | --------------- |
| GPIO   | 25          | 8      | The button GPIO pins will be on Pins RA6, RA7 and RE2 <br> The potentiometer will be on pin RB1 <br> The two LEDs will be on pins RD5 and RD6 <br> The input pin from the upstream header will be on pin RD4 <br> The output pin that goes to the downstream header will be on pin RC5 |
| ADC    | 25          | 0      | N/A             |
| UART   | 2           | 1      | Rx on pin RC7 <br> Tx on pin RC6 |
| SPI    | 2           | 0      | N/A             |
| I2C    | 2           | 2      | SCL1 on pin RC3 <br> SDA1 on pin RC4 |
| PWM    | 2/2         | 0      | N/A             |
| ICSP   | 3           | 3      | MCLR is on RE3 <br> ICSPDAT is on RB7 <br> ICSPCLK is on RB6 |

##### MCC Pin Layout
Below is the pin selection screen in MCC showing all selected pins allocated. It shows the dedicated pins for UART, the I2C pins, the MCLR pin, the open pins for ICSPDAT and ICSPCLK, then all the GPIO pins dedicated to inputs and outputs respectivly. All the pins match the table above with the pin locations. On the left side of the picture it shows the layout of all the pins on the physical microcontroller. The pins are grouped togther in a way that allows space between each section and keeping like pins together for example the Rx and the upstream input are right next to each other while the Tx and the downstream output are next to each other and the two sections are right by each other.

##### MCC Microcontroller details
Below is the setup for the microcontroller where it also shows how many different applications that it can support with its pins.

### Final Selection
I beleive that the PIC18F47Q10-I/PT is the best choice for my subsystem as it supports every function that I need to do while programing it in MPLabX makes it simple to do everything that I need to do for my subsystem. Its numerous pins allow for extra flexibility with my design and the pin selection process in MPLabX lets me visiualize where every connection will be and how they can be grouped together.
