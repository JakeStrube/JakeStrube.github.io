**Choice:** Option 1: SI-8033JD Switching Voltage Regulator

**Rationale:** This swotching voltage regulator emits an output of 3.3 volts when setup with an external circuit like shown in the detailed data sheet. The circuit is not complicated and does not require to many components externally. It also comes at a lower price than either of the other two options.It also allows a current operating range with a max of 1.5 A and a min voltage of 6.3 V with a max of 40V
